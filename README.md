To-Do 
[ ] page to view and edit list of recipes
    [ ] page to view list of recipes
    [ ] ability to click 'view' and be taken to a Recipe page
    [ ] on Recipe page, ability to edit ingredients
[ ] Footer. subtle and with a big enough top margin
[ ]
[ ] home page should show current week worth of recipes, or a button to build out the week if no current recipes exist
[ ] page for 'this week's ingredients with ability to check whether johno already has them?


maybe build out a recipe list as johno starts to use it and eventually have him selecting ingredients from a list, organized by type. Then it would be easier to tell him if an ingredient is required for more than one recipe this week


notes:
    - in NewRecipeForm i am fetching only the one document for previousIngredients for johno's use. so if you want to scale for more users, this will need to be adjusted
