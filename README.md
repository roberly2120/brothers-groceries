To-Do
[ ] connect firestore and build server
[ ] page to enter new recipe
[ ] send new recipe to firestore 
[ ] page to view and edit list of recipes


maybe build out a recipe list as johno starts to use it and eventually have him selecting ingredients from a list, organized by type. Then it would be easier to tell him if an ingredient is required for more than one recipe this week


notes:
    - in NewRecipeForm i am fetching only the one document for previousIngredients for johno's use. so if you want to scale for more users, this will need to be adjusted
